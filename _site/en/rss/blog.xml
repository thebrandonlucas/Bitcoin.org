        <title>Recognizing Recent Efforts By Volunteer Contributors on the Translation Team</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Through continued donations and support from the community, we’re thankful to
have recently been able to send out over $15,000 USD worth of bitcoin as a
gesture of gratitude to people who volunteer to help translate bitcoin.org and
spread the word about Bitcoin. Each month, contributors are helping localize
bitcoin.org so that more people around the world can easily get started and
learn more about Bitcoin in their own languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thank-you&quot;&gt;Thank you&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-get-involved&quot;&gt;How to get involved&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who is fluent in a language that isn’t English can help translate the
site. You can get started by following a few basic steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a free &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.transifex.com/signup/&quot;&gt;Transifex account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Browse to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.transifex.com/bitcoinorg/bitcoinorg/&quot;&gt;bitcoin.org translation
project&lt;/a&gt;, find the language
you’re fluent in, and join the translation team associated with it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you’re on the team you can start translating. Go to the
“Dashboard” on the top of the page, then to “Languages” and select your
language. You will see a lot of different resources and their progress. Each
resource consists of a number of strings. A string is a “string” of text on
bitcoin.org. The first resource (“bitcoin.org”) contains all strings for the
main site. You can start there.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Join the &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.me/bitcoinaroundtheworld&quot;&gt;Telegram group&lt;/a&gt;, feel free to
introduce yourself and let people know if you have questions. :)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;special-acknowledgments&quot;&gt;Special acknowledgments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the many volunteers, many of the advances and recent progress in
the translation project wouldn’t be possible without the help of Simon
Hinterreiter and Koichi Hendrawan, who help manage and organize the translation
project, as well as the teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A special thanks is also owed to Transifex, for providing us with special access
to their platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;about-bitcoinorg&quot;&gt;About bitcoin.org&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin.org was originally registered and owned by Satoshi Nakamoto and Martti
Malmi. When Satoshi left the project, he gave ownership of the domain to
additional people, separate from the Bitcoin developers, to spread
responsibility and prevent any one person or group from easily gaining control
over the Bitcoin project. Since then, the site has been developed and
maintained by different members of the Bitcoin community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being a privately owned site, its code is open-source and there have
been thousands of commits from hundreds of contributors from all over the
world. In addition to this, over a thousand translators have helped to make the
site display natively to visitors in their own languages — now 25 different
languages and growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin.org receives millions of visitors a year from people all over the world
who want to get started with and learn more about Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A New Design for Wallet Pages</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A new, more user-friendly and simple set of pages designed to help people find
an ideal bitcoin wallet is now available. It includes a step-by-step wizard to
help people become more familiar with wallets, ratings to compare how they stack
up alongside other wallets, as well as explanations of features they provide
in order to help people make their own informed decisions. Aside from the
wizard, a completely new comparative table and selector is available so people
can see how wallets fare against one another. This is designed to help
people quickly find a wallet to meet their needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet&quot;&gt;Check out the new wallet pages and curate your own list of
wallets.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-old-design&quot;&gt;The Old Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the old wallet pages presented an assortment of wallets people could
choose from, the experience of doing so was cumbersome and tedious. In order to
see how wallets were rated one would need to navigate to each individual wallet
and then browse back to the overview page to select another wallet to see how
the two might compare. It was not possible to see these comparisons side by
side. One would need to use multiple tabs or browser windows and toggle back and
forth, or a single window, navigating backward and forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the comparative difficulties, millions of people visit
bitcoin.org, many of whom are new to Bitcoin, and have little to no familiarity
with how it works. This is further complicated when a person needs to choose a
bitcoin wallet and has no idea what makes one an optimal choice, what the
features are and what they do, or what they need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new design resolves these issues by allowing people to easily compare
wallets, see how they’re rated and subsequently generate a list of wallets based
on available features - in addition to explaining things each step along the
way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wallet-ratings&quot;&gt;Wallet Ratings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wallets are given one of four ratings - good, acceptable, caution or neutral.
These ratings are applied across six categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control:&lt;/strong&gt; Some wallets give you full control over your bitcoin. This means
no third party can freeze or take away your funds. You are still responsible,
however, for securing and backing up your wallet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Validation:&lt;/strong&gt; Some wallets have the ability to operate as a full node. This
means no trust in a third party is required when processing transactions. Full
nodes provide a high level of security, but they require a large amount of
memory.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparency:&lt;/strong&gt; Some wallets are open-source and can be built
deterministically, a process of compiling software which ensures the resulting
code can be reproduced to help ensure it hasn’t been tampered with.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environment:&lt;/strong&gt; Some wallets can be loaded on computers which are vulnerable
to malware. Securing your computer, using a strong passphrase, moving most of
your funds to cold store or enabling 2FA or multifactor authentication can help
you protect your bitcoin.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy:&lt;/strong&gt; Some wallets make it harder to spy on your transactions by
rotating addresses. They do not disclose information to peers on the network.
They can also optionally let you setup and use Tor as a proxy to prevent others
from associating transactions with your IP address.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fees:&lt;/strong&gt; Some wallets give you full control over setting the fee paid to the
bitcoin network before making a transaction, or modifying it afterward, to
ensure that your transactions are confirmed in a timely manner without paying
more than you have to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These ratings are available to review both on the overview page that includes
all wallets, as well as the individual landing pages for each wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wallet-features&quot;&gt;Wallet Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are nine features people can choose from to sort wallets by. These
features are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2FA:&lt;/strong&gt; Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a way to add additional security
to your wallet. The first ‘factor’ is your password for your wallet. The
second ‘factor’ is a verification code retrieved via text message or from an app
on a mobile device. 2FA is conceptually similar to a security token device that
banks in some countries require for online banking. It likely requires relying
on the availability of a third party to provide the service.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bech32:&lt;/strong&gt; Bech32 is a special address format made possible by SegWit (see
the feature description for SegWit for more info). This address format is also
known as ‘bc1 addresses’. Some bitcoin wallets and services do not yet support
sending or receiving to Bech32 addresses.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Node:&lt;/strong&gt; Some wallets fully validate transactions and blocks. Almost all
full nodes help the network by accepting transactions and blocks from other
full nodes, validating those transactions and blocks, and then relaying them to
further full nodes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardware Wallet Compatibility:&lt;/strong&gt; Some wallets can pair and connect to a
hardware wallet in addition to being able to send to them. While sending to a
hardware wallet is something most all wallets can do, being able to pair with
one is a unique feature. This feature enables you to be able to send and receive
directly to and from a hardware wallet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legacy Addresses:&lt;/strong&gt; Most wallets have the ability to send and receive legacy
bitcoin addresses. Legacy addresses start with 1 or 3 (as opposed to starting
with bc1). Without legacy address support you may not be able to receive bitcoin
from older wallets or exchanges.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lightning:&lt;/strong&gt; Some wallets support transactions on the Lightning Network. The
Lightning Network is new and somewhat experimental. It supports transferring
bitcoin without having to record each transaction on the blockchain, resulting
in faster transactions and lower fees.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multisig:&lt;/strong&gt; Some wallets have the ability to require more than one key to
authorize a transaction. This can be used to divide responsibility and control
over multiple parties.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SegWit:&lt;/strong&gt; Some wallets support SegWit, which uses block chain space more
efficiently. This helps reduce fees paid by helping the Bitcoin network scale
and sets the foundation for second layer solutions such as the Lightning
Network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People can select features that are important to them alongside the ratings
described above, based on their operating system and/or environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;acknowledgments&quot;&gt;Acknowledgments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new wallet page improvements wouldn’t have been possible without donations
from the community, as well as community feedback that we received as various
milestones were passed and presented along the way. A special thanks is also
due to several people who spent a significant amount of their personal time on
this project - Craig Watkins, Cøbra, Natalia Kirejczyk, Alex Cherman, and
Maxwell Mons. Lastly, we appreciate the efforts of many contributors that spent
time reporting issues on GitHub with regard to both the old and new design, that
we were able to resolve as part of this work:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bitcoin.org Content Now Available in 25+ Languages</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;bitcoin-is-spreading&quot;&gt;Bitcoin is Spreading&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog/free/site-now-available-in-25-plus-languages.gif?1729166419&quot; alt=&quot;Bitcoin.org Now Available in 25+ Languages&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the the past year, as part of Bitcoin.org’s ongoing content translation
initiative to help spread information about Bitcoin all around the world, many
people have helped extend and update the site into their own native languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to community donations and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcoin.org/en/posts/new-supporting-sponsorship-from-paxful&quot;&gt;sponsorship from Paxful&lt;/a&gt;,
translators throughout 2018 received bitcoin bonuses in appreciation
for the time and efforts that they had spent volunteering. Bitcoin.org content
is available in 25+ languages including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Arabic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bulgarian&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Danish&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dutch&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;English&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Farsi&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;French&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;German&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Greek&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hindi&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hungarian&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Indonesian&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Italian&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Japanese&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Korean&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mandarin&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Polish&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Portuguese (Brazilian)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Romanian&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Russian&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Serbian&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Slovenian&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spanish&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Swedish&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turkish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the original website domain registered by Satoshi Nakamoto in association
with the technology, and one of the first results people encounter when
searching the web for more information about Bitcoin, this accomplishment
enables billions of people to potentially learn more about it and how to get
started using it as easily as possible. Also, despite being a privately owned
site, Bitcoin.org’s code is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/&quot;&gt;open-source&lt;/a&gt;.
There have been thousands of commits and contributions from hundreds of
contributors and translators. The open source nature by which the site is run,
helps to ensure that new users are still able to find unbiased and qualitative
information about Bitcoin, to make their own informed decisions about which
products and services might be the optimal choice for them to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019, translation coverage will continue to expand across the site into areas
where translated content previously wasn’t available, areas such as the developer
documentation, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you speak English and another language and would like to help spread the word
about Bitcoin, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcoin.org/en/posts/how-to-help-translate&quot;&gt;it’s easy to get started&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks goes to everyone who contributes to make this possible.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.transifex.com/bitcoinorg/bitcoinorg/&quot;&gt;Join the Bitcoin.org translation team&lt;/a&gt;
and select the language you want to translate the site into. Your request to
join a team will be accepted instantly, and you will be a translator for the
language you selected. If your language is not available yet, close the pop-up,
scroll down, and navigate to “Request language”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Play around with the interface. Transifex’s interface can be a bit confusing
and it cannot hurt to take a look around. As a translator, you cannot cause any
harm as you can only edit unreviewed strings. A complete history is saved for
every string, making it impossible to destroy previous work. In the beginning,
stay away from the Glossary as this can be edited by new translators but no
history is saved.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.me/bitcoinaroundtheworld&quot;&gt;Join the Telegram group for translators&lt;/a&gt;.
The website maintainer, both team leaders for translations, a number of language
coordinators, and various translators are present in this group. We are happy to
help in case you need assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Choose what you want to translate. Navigate to the “Dashboard” on the top of
the page, then to “Languages” and select your language. You will see a lot
of different resources and their progress. Each resource consists of a number of
strings. A string is a “string” of text on Bitcoin.org. Each string has three
possible states - “untranslated”, “translated but unreviewed”, and “reviewed”.
Only the first state “untranslated” is relevant for most translators. However,
if you find a “translated but unreviewed” string that contains obvious mistakes,
you are free to correct them. “Reviewed” strings can only be changed or
unreviewed by reviewers. The first resource “bitcoin.org” contains all strings
of the main page. Start here. Everything else that follows starts with
“devdocs…”, indicating that these files are part of the developer
documentation. It is recommended that you only try to translate the developer
documentation if you are an experienced Bitcoin user and/or developer with a
profound understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Start translating. You must be a native or fluent speaker for the language
you choose to translate. Please be careful to preserve the original meaning of
each text. Sentences and popular expressions should sound native in your
language. Translations need to be reviewed by a reviewer or coordinator before
publication. Once reviewed, coordinators will notify the team leaders that a
certain translation is ready for publication. If in doubt, please contact the
coordinator(s) for your language on Transifex.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please take a look at the Responsibilities and Tasks section below to learn
more about the different types of users that you’ll encounter on Transifex
when helping translate Bitcoin.org.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;about-bitcoinorg&quot;&gt;About Bitcoin.org&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin.org was originally registered and owned by Satoshi Nakamoto and Martti
Malmi. When Satoshi left the project, he gave ownership of the domain to
additional people, separate from the Bitcoin developers, to spread
responsibility and prevent any one person or group from easily gaining control
over the Bitcoin project. Since then, the site has been developed and
maintained by different members of the Bitcoin community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being a privately owned site, its code is
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/&quot;&gt;open-source&lt;/a&gt; and there have
been over 3,200 commits from 180 contributors from all over the world. In
addition to this, over 950 translators have helped to make the site display
natively to visitors by default in their own languages — now 25 different
languages and growing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Big Thanks to Recent Translators</title>

  &lt;li&gt;vit05&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Василий33&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big thanks goes to these volunteers. Their work behind the scenes shouldn’t
go unnoticed, and we dedicate this blog post to recognizing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each month, more and more people all around the world are hearing, reading and
learning more about Bitcoin. Seeing a business with a “Bitcoin accepted here”
sign may not be something rare for some of us anymore… but it still is for
many in a lot of places. Even though Bitcoin adoption is spreading like
wildfire, we haven’t even scratched the surface of what could be possible. In
order for knowledge to spread, information has to be freed to transmit easily
from person to person, across borders, across languages, between cultures,
philosophies, religions and ideologies. Some people say we are all Satoshi,
now. For that to ring true, we must find our voice to speak, spread and support
Bitcoin as one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been tens of millions of visitors to Bitcoin.org this year alone.
About half of them speak English. The rest are millions of visitors
speaking all kinds of other languages from across the globe. For them, we rely
on volunteer translators - like the above individuals - people who translate
Bitcoin.org into their own native languages so that when people who speak them
come to Bitcoin.org, the site displays by default in their own native tongue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are currently 70 languages in various states of translation, 27 of which
have reached states of completion that have enabled them to be added to
Bitcoin.org. In addition, earlier this year, the developer documentation was
ported so that it could also start to be translated into other languages. It’s
important that we provide a way to help a new generation of Bitcoin developers
in non English-speaking countries learn more about Bitcoin on a technical
level, to help foster the development of new products and services, for the
people in their communities who are already interested in using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one of the most visited Bitcoin websites, translating Bitcoin.org is a great
way to help Bitcoin continue to spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/blob/master/docs/assisting-with-translations.md#getting-started-with-the-translation-team&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to be like one of the people above and join the effort, learn how to get started.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A special thanks also goes to Simon AKA “Komodorpudel” who has spent a lot of
time co-organizing various translation-related efforts. Thank you, Simon. Lastly,
but not least, to &lt;a href=&quot;https://transifex.com/&quot;&gt;Transifex&lt;/a&gt;, for graciously providing
enterprise-grade localization services to support Bitcoin.org.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
